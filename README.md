## 🎯 What I'm About

I create accessible, low-pressure games that enhance your daily tasks. Think digital pets, idle adventures, and experiences that respect your time while adding a bit of joy.

> **"Why sweat when you don't have to?"**

I love a game with deep lore and hearty mechanics, but I'm a solo dev with only so much time and experience. That's why I choose to make simple, idle games that can be played casually. I make games that I can play while I make games.
