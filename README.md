## Game Dev

### [Panda Blade Software](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45248396)
My little game development "studio" that I use to build games as (mostly) a hobby. I've a huge fan of pixel art and idle games and that's usually my focus. I primarily use [GameMakerStudio](https://gamemaker.io/en) for my engine and [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) for graphics.

## Steam
My ambitions are to release simple pixle art games on Steam at a low price for mindless/idle fun.

```
Little Buddy is a casual pet simulation where you care for a virtual companion. Feed, play, and interact with Buddy while they wander around your screen. Designed to be played alongside other activities, itâ€™s the perfect idle game to keep your little friend happy and healthy.

### Hopefully More Coming

I continue to work on pet projects that hopefully see the light of day!
